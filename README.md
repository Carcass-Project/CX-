CX22 - The all-new Carcass compiler for ease of use, and implementation.
It turns Carcass code into IL, that can be run by the .NET/Mono runtimes.

It uses the Yoakke Lexer/Parser generators to keep it all simple.
Also, I'll mention that all new Carcass versions will be sent to this repository.

# Can I contribute?

Of course you can! I always welcome pull requests with new features.
I tend to review them relatively fast, but sometimes it may take a while, but don't worry at all, I will review it.

# Help! I have an issue with the compiler or language!
You can leave it in the Issues tab. We have Compiler Issue and Programming Issue tags for them.
Don't be shy to do it!
